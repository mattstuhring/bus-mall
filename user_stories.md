# User Stories

## Developer
- As a developer, I want to design a UI that is easy for the user to understand, so that anyone using the sight will generate data with no outside helop necessary.

- As a developer, I want to display 3 random images to the user, so that they are not seeing repeats that would influence there decisions.

- As a developer, I need to add event listeners to each image, so that I am able to capture what image the user has selected and then be able to add that to the data.

- As a developer, I want to make sure the user is never shown duplicate images from the previous image set.  This will keep our data more accurate.

- As a developer, I want to keep track of the users selection amount and only allow a user to make 25 selections.  After that I remove the event listener so no other selections can be made.

- As a developer, I want to display the total of clicks and times shown for each image selected or shown.

## Marketing Team
- As the marketing team, we want to display all available products to the best of our ability throughout the 25 sets.  Our products are important to us and want the user be able to see all of them.

- As the marketing team, we want to make sure no products are repeated when the user selects an image and is shown a new set.  If we do repeat products being shown our data will not be accurate which will be not effective in what we are trying to achieve.

- As the marketing team, we want a well designed UI.  The user needs to presented the products with the proper presentation.

- As the marketing team, we want to keep track of all of our necessary data.  This data is super important to us and needs to be properly tracked so we can consume it for further research.
