# User Stories

## As a developer, I want to design a UI that is easy for the user to understand, so that anyone using the sight will generate data with no outside helop necessary.

## As a developer, I want to display 3 random images to the user, so that they are not seeing repeats that would influence there decisions.

## As a developer, I need to add event listeners to each image, so that I am able to capture what image the user has selected and then be able to add that to the data.

## As a developer, I want to make sure the user is never shown duplicate images from the previous image set.  This will keep our data more accurate.

## As a developer, I want to keep track of the users selection amount and only allow a user to make 25 selections.  After that I remove the event listener so no other selections can be made.

## As a developer, I want to display the total of clicks and times shown for each image selected or shown.
